swayfx-setup
=============

Provisioning skeleton for configuring a SwayFX-based Wayland desktop on FreeBSD 14.3. It targets swayfx + swayidle + swaylock-effects plus foot, wofi, eww-wayland (pulls GTK/WebKit deps), dunst, grim, slurp, wl-clipboard, and noto-basic fonts, and ships a dotfile layout ready to sync into `~/.config`.

Current state: scaffolding only; installation scripts and configs still need implementation.
